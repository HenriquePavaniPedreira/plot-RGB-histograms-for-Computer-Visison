# plot-RGB-histograms-for-Computer-Visison
This repository contains a short Python script to plt histograms of the RGB channels of an image, this is part of my early studies about computer vision
<h2>Description: </h2>
Every digital image is formed by three colors (red, green and blue), all these colors could be represented by a matrix of grey shades between 0 and 256, because of this is possible to quantify the RGB values to a better understanding of the image in a Computer Vision field.
<h2>How to Run: </h2>
Just run the srcipt with the command Python3 Script.py on the terminal and enter the sample image path, the result is in portuguese language
